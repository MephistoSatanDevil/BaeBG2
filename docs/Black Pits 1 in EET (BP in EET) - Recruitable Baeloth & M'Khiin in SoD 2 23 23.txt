DESIGN NOTES


Forenotes
I want to be able to play BP in EET (Black Pits in EET), win, and later recruit Baeloth in SoD.  Normally, beating Baeloth in BP via this mod stops M’Khiin and him from being recruitable in SoD.

Why?

His personality and voice made him my favorite of all NPCs in the Enhanced Editions of BG!  The fact that he’s also a Drow and a Sorcerer made him a high priority for inclusion for me in our party!

However, beating Baeloth in BG1’s Black Pits pre-SoD would likely scar him and turn him into an enemy.  That was why in previous BP in EET versions, his SoD Black Pits scene never played.

This document is meant to fix that, as well as remind modders that adding recruitable NPC interjections for being shunted into the Underdark in a fighting pit in BG1 is bad news.  As of this writing, only Drizzt is included because he’s such a notable figure and Baeloth would likely have something important to say.  (I received permission from Roberciik, the as-of-this-writing current maintainer of the Drizzt Saga and Region of Terror mods, and subtledoctor, the author of BP in EET.)


Design Goals
* Make a text script where Baeloth’s character is properly portrayed while also accounting for the events of BP and SoD.  Previous discussions allowed for a small number of major possibilities regarding what happened to Baeloth after BP and before SoD.  Here are some main reasons why Baeloth and CHARNAME may team up in SoD post-BP.

   * Acting.  Baeloth remembers what happened but plays it off like he doesn’t.  Baeloth the Entertainer is effectively a bard.  He’s a drow.  He’s adjusted to deception, and CHARNAME came along at the right time to help him.
        

        This is the main approach I used since it made the most sense to me.

   * Amnesia.  He simply didn’t remember what happened.  Dying can do that to people in D&D.

   * Chance.  He hasn’t forgotten overall what happened, but it escaped his mind at this time.

   * Clones or doubles.  In this case, the Baeloth that was in the Black Pits is simply a separate Baeloth we find in SoD.

   * Forgiveness.  Baeloth forgave CHARNAME or just doesn’t consider CHARNAME a threat any longer.  It’s a desperate solution and the default one for SoD.

   * Self-Preservation.  Baeloth knows that CHARNAME beat him once, but if Baeloth stays close to CHARNAME, Baeloth may be able to use CHARNAME as bait or/and learn what he can.  This approach also means that Baeloth follows CHARNAME with a significant amount of respect or/and fear.


      * Give CHARNAME more options on how to handle Baeloth after they meet up.  Baeloth’s “Black Pits 1.5” is a bomb and everyone involved knows it.  CHARNAME - Baeloth’s former champion - arrives just in time to add some liveliness to the mix!
        With this approach, CHARNAME is able to enter the arena and either cooperate with M’Khiin to persuade her into winning peacefully by summoning the spirits to bother Baeloth as normal, or fight her, beat her, and win Baeloth’s respect.  Killing M’Khiin is one way for any CHARNAME to recruit Baeloth if they choose.
        Also, a high CHA CHARNAME can persuade Baeloth to join - or to fight one-on-one in a final rematch against Baeloth.
        Regardless of CHA, CHARNAME can also just tell Baeloth to leave with or without M’Khiin assuming she survives.

      * Give the player a unique experience.  In the BG series, normally it’s your group against the enemy’s group.  The final fight in this proposal against Baeloth - if the player chooses it - and the fight against M’Khiin - again, if the player chooses it - are intentionally 1 on 1.

      * Give more use to CHARNAME’s CHA stat.  Most people dump CHA for good reason - at least in vanilla BG.  Certain classes need it, like a Fighter >> Druid dual class normally needs 17(!) CHA.  The mod Scales of Balance is a notable exception, making CHA useful for most creatures.
        The stat checks in this proposal reward those who have a high CHA (16+), even if only briefly such as via the friends spell.  It’s intentional that telling Baeloth to visit the Coalition Camp instead of joining CHARNAME right away requires less CHA to persuade him.

      * Make it seem like a piece of cut official content.  In large part, this was because I used as many voiced lines as possible.  This mostly pertains to Baeloth since he’s the star of this scene, but his personality was, to me, too good to waste!  Fortunately for us, Baeloth has 2(!) player voice sets - one for his recruitable NPC and another added in 2.6 called AoN: Baeloth.  He also has many other voiced lines from The Black Pits, BG1, and SoD - some of which I repurposed for use with Baeloth’s dialog.  The appropriate sources are listed per line.
        M’Khiin has fewer voiced lines readily available, and I’ve liked her less as a character, but I repurposed as many voiced lines as possible to fit the situation.


Notable Assumptions
         * I didn’t account for every opportunity for companions to interject.  I know of some relevant to this scene, but NPCs should still interject in ways that are relevant to this scene.

         * I am divided on whether the other 'cosmetic' dialog options should exist as part of the initial dialog.  (Normally there are 4 initial options, but I only presented 1.)  All of these other initial dialog options would funnel to the same result.
