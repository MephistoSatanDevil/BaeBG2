Baeloth, much like BG1, is still running from the Underdark. I headcanon he got too arrogant & the matron mothers put a hit on him. Obviously the surface was the only safe place after that.,

Also, much like in BG1, Baeloth joins the party for protection. Drow don't have many options on the surface (case in point Viconia). He will never outright admit this.,

He likely heard about the arena in the Copper Coronet & went to investigate. That's why we find him there.,

He planned to overthrow the current owners & take over the Copper Coronet. Obviously that plan goes sideways once they learn he's drow & he's back with the party now. ,

Baeloth does, however, still intend to rebuild his Black Pits V2.0. Bigger & better than ever. Throughout SOA he will try to recruit companions  & NPCs to join this future venture.,

He's also writing a book.  His focus will switch more to that during late SOA/TOB.,

Early NPC banter arc thoughts. He & Edwin are rivals of sorts. He has a soft spot for Imoen. He manages to recruit Korgan to his arena.,

Baeloth delights in poking, prodding & teasing. That will feature in many banters with other companions.,

Speaking of, for the Underdark section, I've kept him in the party.  I find that players don't like when you suddenly YEET away one of their companions (even if only temporarily). KEEP THE TEAM TOGETHER! ,

Obviously there's a degree of danger that comes with returning to the Underdark. But Baeloth is nothing if not inventive. He can talk to the drow at the gates - if the PC asks him to - & gain them access. We'd still need Adalon's disguises beforehand mind you.,

I like the idea of an investor (Jarlaxle) . On entering Ust Natha, Baeloth will tell the party to find this investor for him. NEW QUEST!,

Bonus points if they run into Jarlaxle & Baeloth introduces the party as his 'pack of new recruits for the arena'. Thanks for throwing us under the bus axe, Bae.,

We can decide if that meeting goes well - & Baeloth gains funding & a new ally - or goes poorly. I'm undecided  but leaning towards it going bad. We do, after all, want to keep him in the party afterwards.,

We can branch that quest - so he succeeds with the PC's help (stat checks) - or fail. More work, obviously, but reactivity. ,

He should delight in being allowed into Suld. His surface cousins having to rely on a drow's help to fight drow?  Poetic cinema!,

At present he has two quests: Real Housewives of Athkatla - silly component - & the Jarlaxle quest in the Underdark. Do we want something for TOB too? ,

There is a friendship track of sorts. The player can consider Baeloth a friend, Baeloth can consider them a more useful ally than most other fodder.,

We should talk about epilogues! Do we stick with one epilogue or branch based off dialogue / quest choices? I'd like to nail a first draft & start hinting towards it via banters & dialogues.,
