# BG2EE Baeloth CHARNAME banter
## Spellhold Asylum - Exterior
* BAELOTH: An arcane asylum awaits? Expect no easy egress from there after entry!
* CHARNAME: Feeling nervous, Baeloth?
* BAELOTH: I smell the spell components from here. It's like home in the worst of ways!
* CHARNAME: What do you mean, Baeloth?
* BAELOTH: Trial, tribulation, and torment from some talented taskmaster that is -not- yours truly! Only agony awaits us within!
* CHARNAME: But my companion Imoen is in there!
* BAELOTH: Yes, yes. Your childhood cohort was captured as a contrivance to ensnare you.

## Resurrection Gorge
* BAELOTH: This place is portrayed as an in-person picturesque pastel painting parted by departing plant life. Pretty!
#### If Dorn is in the party.
* DORN: I expected more from you, -drow-, not what could pass as simple-minded poetry!
* BAELOTH: Our violent venture will wait a bit, but our reprieve has ended.

## Tree of Life
* BAELOTH: Fresh air? Bird song? Wind whistling through the branches? I despise it all!
#### Display this after the dialog with Ellesime.
* ELLESIME: Do it quickly, Child of Bhaal! If Jon drains the Tree of Life, all of Suldanessellar is doomed... and Jon will have the power he craves! Please, you *must* stop him!
* BAELOTH: Oh, ho ho! Before this morning, I never expected the elven queen to be -begging- me to help! This hope helps my blackened heart beat faster!
* CHARNAME: Baeloth, get over yourself. Now is NOT the time to celebrate! We haven't even beaten Irenicus yet!
* BAELOTH: Whatever happens with the exiled elf, her words are a victory for all drowkind! I can see it now as we meet the queen!
* BAELOTH: Fall to your knees and beg for mercy. I'm sure you know the drill.
* CHARNAME: You do have a point, Baeloth. It was a relief to see the elves put down a notch!
* BAELOTH: Ooh, that felt good! (from AoN: Baeloth sound set)
* CHARNAME: Baeloth, I thought you were better than that!
* BAELOTH: Being -despised- by my distant kin and -hated- for my black skin and underground heritage has a way of making me want to rub it in the face and in the groin of every elf who's so proud of himself for being right that his head should be stuck up his ass like an aberration!
* BAELOTH: So, no, <CHARNAME>, I am -absolutely- taking this opportunity to piss on the elves who pissed off my ancestors!
* CHARNAME: Petty revenge won't solve anything!
* BAELOTH: I am Baeloth Barrityl, Showman of Showmen and Entertainer of Entertainers! I amuse mortals -en masse- with tales of â€˜petty revenge.'
* BAELOTH: I would be a poor practitioner of my profession if I did not.
* BAELOTH: It inspires fighters, even if it caused me to perish in my inaugural Black Pits!
* CHARNAME: What do you make of this situation?
* BAELOTH: Oh, ho, ho! What have we here? Our exiled elf is exciting the environment, endangering it!
* CHARNAME: Anyway, Baeloth, we still need to -help- the elven queen for her to live long enough to help us in return!
* BAELOTH: Yes, I know.

## Watcher's Keep
* BAELOTH: We can -finally- watch the watchers of Watcher's Keep. From what I've read, this castle's interior is a colossal coliseum kept to contain a copious count of curs.
* CHARNAME: Curs? What?
* BAELOTH: What else do you call people in an interplanar prison? Patrons?
* CHARNAME: How do you know about this place, Baeloth?
* BAELOTH: Some curious customer of the Copper Coronet kept books of certain subjects before he became a contender and I kept them from his corpse.
* CHARNAME: Let's go, Baeloth. Progress awaits.
* BAELOTH: <Baeloth flashes you a knowing smile.>

## Forest of Tethyr
* BAELOTH: Such a flock of foliage flourishes around us!
* BAELOTH: However, what a relief! Hell is behind us and... disgustingly fresh air is around us! I already smell the animal sewage!
* BAELOTH: Still, this place looks dangerous and ominous in its own delightful way.
* CHARNAME: Now that you mention it, this place feels unwelcoming.
* BAELOTH: Did you -not- expect that exiled Irenicus to have a collection of contingencies - spell or otherwise - if we countered his conspiracy?
* BAELOTH: Even in death he may be mockingly making rude gestures at us!
* CHARNAME: It's better than Hell, -that's- for sure!
* BAELOTH: What an -obvious- observation.
* CHARNAME: Let's look around. Be on your guard.
* BAELOTH: <Baeloth winks.>

## Forest of Tethir After Returning the Rhynn Lanthorn to Elhan
* BAELOTH: Suldanessellar shall soon see our strength! So long, civilization!
