# Bucket's Intro
Quick, not-fully-workshopped version.

## OPENING CUTSCENE

Baeloth in the Copper Coronet, he's heckling in the direction of the arena.

== ZDBAE What a wretched waste! How boring and banal this brawl is! Were I to grace these grounds with my talents, tragedy would instead transform into triumph. I would bring power, prestige and panache to this pitiful pit. Someone should displace - dare I say depose - of the dullard who dared to direct such a dreary display. Perhaps... me?

## MEMBERS OF THE CROWD START JOINING IN

== SPECTATOR You have the right of it.
== SPECTATOR I have not been entertained!
== SPECTATOR If you've got a plan, I'm in. Can't be much harder starting a fight than watching one.

Then huddle close my hapless horde. The time of tedium is about to be terminated.

## RECRUITMENT DIALOGUE

== ZDBAE Come to praise the paragon of performance have you? You've heard the whispers of my wondrous plan perhaps?

++ Whatever mischief you're initiating, I want no part in it. + YeetsOut
++ If it's real entertainment you're seeking, perhaps you'll join my party instead? + JoinThePartyPleaseBae

IF ~~ YeetsOut
== ZDBAE What I propose is not mere mischief. It is a masterstroke of magnificent mayhem. A grand and glorious revolution. Alas if you wish to wither away in this wasteland of mediocrity, the door is down that way.

IF ~~ JoinThePartyPleaseBae
== ZDBAE As tempting as your mundane mission sounds, I already have majestic machinations in motion. My talents are too prodigious for your petty pursuits.

## Baeloth Discovered

The crowd notices baeloth is a drow. likely, while he was waving his hands about, his hood came off. Much akin to viconia's from her talk. they turn on him. dialogue will have to be a chain to allow it.

== SPECTATOR A drow? Here?
== SPECTATOR Throw him in the arena!
== SPECTATOR Burn the drow!
== SPECTATOR Bloody the drow!

## BAELOTH WISELY RECONSIDERS OUR OFFER

== ZDBAE Upon further reflection, I reconsider. I shall join your party of plenty after all. These misguided masses seem rather misinformed, don't you think? Let us be off, before Baeloth the Brilliant becomes Baeloth the Blood-soaked.

# Notes

Maybe we set baeloth to look like the hooded man in sod before revealing him.
